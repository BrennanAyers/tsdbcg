- This request is used to start a new Game with a single Player. The Game does not start, as it does not have the required number of Players, but others will now be able to join using the Game ID.
- Example Request:
- - `POST api/v1/games` `BODY: { newPlayer: { name: "Ted" } }`
- Example Response:
- - `Status: 201`
- - `Body: { playerName: "Ted", playerId: 1, gameId: 1 }`
